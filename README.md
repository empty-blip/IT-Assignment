Script for Pitch

Asad: Inroducing Findler, the app where you can find anything you want.
Sufwan: Not only that, but you can play Minigames with friends!

Asad: The way it works is through a button which you can connect to the Findler app on your mobile phone.
Asad: Once connected, the button sends blutooth signals which echo through devices until it reaches your phone. Now, you may be thinking that this is like the Apple airtag, but there are a couple of differences.
Sufwan: One key difference are the pysical properties. The Findler Button is smaller and more stickier, which allows it to be attached to a more variety of devices. The Findler Button also features a very large battery life. It can last up to 3 months on a single charge! Another thing that Findler features are games. One of them is replica of a classic game of Hot & Cot!

Asad: Find It is a Minigame where you can play with friends to find hidden objects. You can play with friends, as long as they haev the Findler app.
Asad: It is very easy to play with friends.
Asda: All you need to do is send a request to play with your friends, and if they accept, you can play with them! You can play with as many people as you like!
Sufwan: Once you have all the people, you can then select which person you want to be the hider, either through voting or through self-voulentearing.
Sufwan: Then, the person can hide the object and the seekers have to find it with the help of the colours of the screen, which replicate how the game Hot & Cold would work.
Sufwan: If you are getting closer to the object, or warmer in other terms, the screen will turn more red, but if you are going more away, the screen wil turn more blue.
